**Ambassador Edge Stack is now available and includes additional functionality beyond the current Emissary.**
These features include automatic HTTPS, OAuth/OpenID Connect authentication support, integrated rate
limiting, a developer portal, and [more](/edge-stack-faq/).

## Emissary integrations

If you still want to use just Emissary, don't worry! Emissary
is currently available out-of-the-box in some Kubernetes installers and local environments.
